    p 1. Tracks rewatch related posts on #[a(href='https://reddit.com/r/anime')= '/r/anime'], and links back to #[a(href='https://reddit.com/r/anime')= '/r/anime']
    p 2. Posts with titles following a certain pattern will be grouped together, allowing people to follow a group and receive notifications as soon as a new post of the group is live.
    p 3. PTW Soon List, or Plan to Watch Soon List, users pick only 3 series to add to their lists. Intended to help gauge which series the community might want to rewatch soon.

    p 1-1. Links of posts on #[a(href='https://reddit.com/r/anime')= '/r/anime'] with "rewatch"(caps don't matter) in the title are automatically collected here and listed from newest to the oldest.
    p 1-2. Scores are updated every 30 minutes for the first day.
    p 1-3. If a post is deleted on #[a(href='https://reddit.com/r/anime')= '/r/anime'], the link here would also automatically be deleted in 30 minutes.
    p 2-1. Posts with titles following the patterns below will be grouped(caps don't matter):
    p.font-weight-bold.ml-3.mb-0.text-success A.
    p.font-weight-bold.ml-4.text-success {la bla bla} interest for {a|an} {title} rewatch {bla bla bla}
    p.font-weight-bold.ml-3.mb-0.text-success B.
    p.font-weight-bold.ml-4.text-success [Rewatch][Spoilers] {title} {-|episode|movie|ova|part} {bla bla bla}
    p 2-2. Posts with the same {title} and same poster would be considered the same group. Allowing users to follow it by clicking Follow on the front page or in each of the group pages.
    p 2-3. Users can also switch on the Notifications on the front page or the group pages to receive notifications, if your browser supports it.
    p 2-4. Notifications link directly to the posts.
    p 3-1. The series data and cover images for you to pick comes from #[a(href='https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/')= 'animenewsnetwork'].
    p 3-2. Update with #[a(href='https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/')= 'animenewsnetwork'] isn't very frequent, so current and future titles may be missing. Though it shouldn't matter because this is intended for rewatches.
